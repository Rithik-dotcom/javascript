Q1// Write a JavaScript program that receives as a number a user input. This number represents temperature in Celsius. Program should convert it to Fahrenheit and print the temperature in Fahrenheit in the console.

// Note, use the following formula to convert temperature: 

// F = C*(9/5)+32 
// where F — temperature is Fahrenheit and C — in Celsius.

// Sample Input: 
// 37
// Sample Output: 
// 98.6


var recievedNumber = prompt("Enter temperature in Celsius:");
var farenheit =  recievedNumber*(9/5) +32;
console.log(`Temp in celsius ${recievedNumber} in farenheit is ${farenheit.toFixed(2)}`)

Q2//// Write a JavaScript program that receives a string as a user input. Then the program should print in the console the following:
// 1) received string converted into lowercase;
// 2) the number of characters in the string;
// 3) the first and the last characters of the string. 

// Provide proper comments for each part of the program.

// Sample Input: 
// “Marvel Wolverine”


// Sample output: 
// "marvel wolverine" 
// 16
// “m”
// “e”

var userInput = prompt('');
var result = userInput.toLowerCase()
console.log(result)
console.log(result.length);
console.log(result.charAt(0))
console.log(result.charAt(result.length-1))




Q3//// Write a JavaScript program that accepts two strings as user input. The program should determine the first occurrence of the second string within the first string. And then print into the console the second string along with the last remaining characters of the first string. Print the string in capital letters.

// Sample Input: 
// “University”
// “ver”


// Sample output: 
// “VERSITY”

var firstString = prompt("what is your first string :")
var secondString = prompt("what is your second string :")


var result = firstString.indexOf(secondString)
console.log(firstString.slice(result, firstString.length).toUpperCase())



Q4//// Write a JavaScript program that accepts a word as a user input, reverses it, and then print into the console the new word with the first letter capital.

// Sample Input: 
// “Hawkeye”


// Sample output: 
// “Eyekwah”


var word = prompt("Enter a word:");

let result = word.split("").reverse().join("")
let capitalWord = result.charAt(0).toUpperCase()
let finalWord = result.replace(result.charAt(0),capitalWord)
console.log(finalWord)

Q5// // Your office wants to create a general form to register its employee details.

// Write a JavaScript program to accept First Name, Last Name, Age, Gender, Contact Number and Cit as a user inputs. Then prints into the console the string in the format mentioned in the sample output.

// Peter Parker who is a male, aged 25 years, lives in New York. Peter’s contact number is 9988776655.

let Fname = prompt("first Name: ")
let Lname = prompt("Last Name: ")
let Age = prompt("Age : ")
let Sex = prompt("Gender: ")
let Phone = prompt("Mob number: ")
let City = prompt("city: ")


console.log(`${Fname} ${Lname} who is a ${Sex}, aged ${Age} years, lives in ${City}. ${Fname}'s contact number is ${Phone}' `)

Q6 // Write a JS program that accepts a text and two non-identical words as separate user inputs. Then the program should find the second input word inside the text and replace it with the third input word. Print the new text into the console along with the changed words in the format given in sample output.

// Sample Input: 
// “This is a javascript chapter”
// “chapter”
// “topic”

// Sample output: 
// This is a javascript topic, where “chapter” is replaced by “topic”.

 var mainInput = prompt("Enter the main sentence :")
 var second = prompt("")
 var third = prompt("")
 
 var secondInMain = mainInput.replace(second, third)
 console.log(secondInMain)

Q7 // You are planning to buy some goods on Amazon. You have added the products to the cart. Also after adding your products , you can see a discount on the total cart amount.

// Write a JavaScript program to accept the product name, the price of the product, the number of items, and the discount value as user inputs. After accepting all the information, calculate and find the subtotal before and after the discount.

var productName = prompt(" Enter the Name of Product: ")
var numberOfProducts = prompt("Enetr number Of products: ")
var priceOfProduct = prompt("Enter price of product :")
var discountPercentage = prompt("Enter discount % :")

console.log(`You have successfully purchased ${numberOfProducts} products titled “${productName}”.
 Amount before the discount is Rs ${priceOfProduct*numberOfProducts}.
 Amount after the ${discountPercentage}% discount is Rs. ${priceOfProduct*numberOfProducts-(priceOfProduct*numberOfProducts*discountPercentage)/100}.`)
